To clone TeamCode, do the following:

Note: Some names start with "Team" and others start with "team".  This is intentional.

1)  Using your operating system file management tools, copy the whole "TeamCode"
    folder to a sibling folder with a corresponding new name, eg: "Team0417".
Team11096Code
	
2)  In the new Team11096Code folder, delete the TeamCode.iml file.

3)  the new Team11096Code folder, rename the "src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode" folder
    to a matching name with a lowercase 'team' eg:  "team0417".
team11096code
	
4)  In the new Team11096Code/src/main folder, edit the "AndroidManifest.xml" file, change the line that contains
         package="org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode"
    to be
         package="org.firstinspires.ftc.team11096code"

5)  Add:    include ':Team11096Code' to the "ftc_app/settings.gradle" file.

6)  Open up Android Studios and clean out any old files by ising the menu to "Build/Clean Project"

If you want to import old code instead of starting again from templates and samples:

7) Paste your old code into folder 
ftc_app\Team11096Code\src\main\java\org\firstinspires\ftc\team11096code

8) Change first line to "package org.firstinspires.ftc.team11096code;"
